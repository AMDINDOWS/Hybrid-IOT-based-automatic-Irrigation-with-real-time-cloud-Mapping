# Hybrid-IOT-based-automatic-Irrigation-with-real-time-cloud-Mapping

the whole module uses Arduino, ESP8266 WifI Module, analog soil moisture sensor and UBIDOTS Cloud platform for real time visualization of the data coming from the sensor through Wifi.

For this code to work :
1.) a user needs to make an account on www.ubidots.com
2.)make a new file on the "Dashboard"
3.)put in a chart/gharp feature
4.)copy Token and API Key and put it into the code


the charts that are created on the online platform can easily be copied and integrated with any webpage or android app in minutes,
also Excel sheets can be downloaded for the data history.

The hardware device is also connected to the pump motor to start,increase,decrease or stop the flow of water for a best way of 
irrigating the fields resulting in better crop growth and less water consumption.
